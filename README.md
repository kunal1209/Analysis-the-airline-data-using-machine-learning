# Airline-Project-Using-Machine-Learning
•	This project focuses on predicting flight delays using advanced machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
•	 Leveraging Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, along with visualization tools such as Matplotlib, the project effectively analyzes large datasets to provide accurate predictions. 
•	It explores feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance, enabling the identification of key factors contributing to delays. 
•	The model's performance is rigorously evaluated using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics, ensuring its reliability. 
•	This project serves as a valuable tool for airlines to optimize scheduling and for passengers to improve travel planning by anticipating delays.
